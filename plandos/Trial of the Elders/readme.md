# Trial of the Elders
This seed is a proof-of-concept for my the plandomizer. My goal when designing this seed was to create a route that a) Requires tricks/skips that are rarely seen in normal randomizer runs and b) maintain a high trick to gameplay ratio. As a result the seed is quite difficult, requiring a different trick every minute or so. I imagine this seed would be interesting to speedrun, as it comes off as quite the gauntlet.

# Features

- Hand-shuffled elevator locations
- Hand-shuffled door colors

# Hints/Spoilers

I tried my best to design the gameplay progression in the most intuitive way possible. If you want the best experience, go in blind without reading anything below. Otherwise, this section is sorted by increasing spoilery-ness. 

<details>
  <summary>Mild Hints</summary>

- Forget what you know about the randomizer logic. This romhack expects you to get creative.

- The large majority of progression items are locked behind sequence-breaking tricks and vice versa

- Don't skimp on e-tanks

- All bosses are required except for Incinerator Drone and Phazon Elite

- Not all elevators are bi-directional. Not all elevators are used (some don't take you anywhere)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Moderate Hints</summary>

- Varia Suit and Spider Ball aren't anywhere in this seed

- Wallcrawling is not required until you have Morph Ball, Morph Ball Bombs and Space Jump.

- Wallcrawling is only required in Chozo Ruins. You're wasting time if you enter a secret world anywhere else.

- X-Ray is in Phendrana Shorelines and Phazon Suit is in Plasma Processing. Get these before entering Phazon Mines.
