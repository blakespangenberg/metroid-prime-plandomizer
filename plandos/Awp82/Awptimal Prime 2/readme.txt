same trick level as AP1 (trivial-normal), 
same concept: a re-imagined "intended" route for the game with shuffled elevators/items, 
which can be sequence-broken with more advanced tricks (beyond normal) if the player desires. 
there's one potential softlock room if you go in without the item you need to get out, 
but otherwise, it's fully beatable.
