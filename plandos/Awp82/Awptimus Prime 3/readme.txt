Awptimus Prime 3,

The third seed in my Metroid Prime Plandomizer series, with shuffled items, elevator destinations, and door colors (including new door types). 
When you start, there are three paths you can take; an easy one, a hard one, and a harder one. Take your pick. You can only commit to one path at a time, so choose wisely. 
When the paths converge, find the required items to beat the game (final bosses included).

Expected trick level: mostly trivial-normal, with two optional hard and insane tricks, respectively (all in-bounds). 
Overall difficulty: potentially easy, medium, or extremely hard, depending on the player's choice(s).

I've play-tested this seed and confirmed that it's beatable. There are no intended softlocks. If you encounter any that I've missed, please let me know.

Good luck and have fun!
