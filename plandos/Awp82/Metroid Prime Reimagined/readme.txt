A partially randomized "re-imagining" of the vanilla game, 
with a partially different item progression route (with 2 shuffled elevators), 
including 3 additional item requirements (wavebuster, ice spreader, and flamethrower) 
to beat the game. Frigate Orpheon intro sequence, item-acquisition pop-ups, and final bosses included. 
Trick level: dev-intended only. No known softlocks as of yet. Play-tested by Uncle Reggie.

Please let me know if you find any problems with it (i.e. softlocks, duplicate items, or any other oversights) 
and I will patch them accordingly,
