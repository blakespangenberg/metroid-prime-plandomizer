# Trial of the World
- A fairly generous, beginner-friendly plando featuring slight pathing options. Those comfortable with more advanced tricks may be able to save some time but they are not required. Early handholding is intentional, but things start to open up exponentially.

# Features
- Intended to be a "re-imagining" of the original game if small standable terrain exploits were to have been expected of the player. The vast majority of "required" tricks fall into this category. This one is intended to be accessible for as many players as possible, hence, Trial of the World.
- Gully

# Required Techniques
- Standable terrain exploits 

## Not Required
- Most tricks, but they may speed things up considerably...

# Hints/Spoilers
- Beam doors are changed to influence intended/possible routing options. Will it pay off to follow that changed door?
